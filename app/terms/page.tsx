                <h2>4. Escrow, Payouts &amp; Disputes</h2>
                <p>
                  Funds committed to a milestone are held in platform escrow. When a student delivers work
                  conforming to the agreed specification and the client approves (or the dispute-free inspection
                  window elapses), funds are released to the student.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the event of a deliverable dispute, UniPact acts as an objective mediator reviewing the
                  digital ledger of deliverables against the initial job scope to determine fair allocation or
                  refund of escrowed amounts.

                <p>
                  Upon full release of milestone funds from escrow, all agreed intellectual property, source
                  code, design assets, and marketing collateral transfer to the client company, unless
                  explicitly stated otherwise in the project brief. The student retains the right to reference
                  the project in their personal portfolio.
